# Developing-a-Handwritten-Digits-Classifier-with-PyTorch-Project

# Dataset:
The project utilized the MNIST dataset, a widely recognized dataset comprising grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset, available through torchvision.datasets, was preprocessed using PyTorch transforms to convert the images into tensors, apply normalization, and flatten the data for model training.

# Objective:
The goal of this project was to build a neural network using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits with a high level of accuracy. The target was to achieve a test accuracy of at least 90%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in recognizing and classifying numerical inputs. Key steps included:

Preprocessing and visualizing the dataset to understand the input data.
Constructing, training, and optimizing a PyTorch neural network.
Evaluating model accuracy and making improvements through hyperparameter tuning.
Saving the trained model for future reuse.

# Application:
This project showcases the practical application of neural networks in image classification tasks. The developed handwritten digit classifier has potential use cases in:

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems.
Digitizing handwritten forms and documents.
Automating digit-based data entry tasks.
Through various project steps, including dataset exploration, neural network construction, and performance evaluation, the classifier achieved an impressive test accuracy of 96.54%, surpassing the initial target. The saved model can be easily integrated into systems requiring digit classification capabilities.
